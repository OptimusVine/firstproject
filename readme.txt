The goal of this project is to create a simple UI that can:

1. read from PLM
2. Allow the user to enter data
3. Send an email that contains the user entered data and data from PLM


Requirements
- When a user goes to the site, it will prompt for wines 
- The user will enter data into a text box
- An email will be generated to kjiel@clubw.com with the wine info and the data entered

I have added and changed this file.
